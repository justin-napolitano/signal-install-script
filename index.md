# Signal Desktop Installation Script

This script automates the process of installing Signal Desktop on 64-bit Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Mint.

## Prerequisites

- A 64-bit Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint)
- Administrative (sudo) privileges

## Script Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. Installs the official Signal public software signing key.
2. Adds the Signal repository to the system's list of repositories.
3. Updates the package database and installs Signal Desktop.

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Save the Script

Save the following script to a file, e.g., `install_signal.sh`:

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# 1. Install the official public software signing key
echo "Installing the Signal public software signing key..."
wget -O- https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor > signal-desktop-keyring.gpg
cat signal-desktop-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

# 2. Add the Signal repository to the list of repositories
echo "Adding the Signal repository to the list of repositories..."
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main' |\
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list

# 3. Update the package database and install Signal
echo "Updating the package database..."
sudo apt update

echo "Installing Signal Desktop..."
sudo apt install -y signal-desktop

echo "Signal Desktop installation completed successfully!"
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the following command to make the script executable:

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x install_signal.sh
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Execute the Script

Run the script with the following command:

\`\`\`bash
./install_signal.sh
\`\`\`
